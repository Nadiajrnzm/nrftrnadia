I was born on 13 December 2002 in a hospital in Klang, Selangor. I have four siblings and am the youngest in the family.

        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">My favourite subjects are Malay, History, Islamic Education and Science. I am interested in theory-based fields and aspire to become an archivist. I am an ambitious person. I want to become a knowledgeable person to achieve success in life and always be respected.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">I like various songs as long as they sound good to my ears. However, I now like the song from my favourite singer Billie Eilish entitled TV.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">I have a happy family. I am very grateful to God because my life is complete with the presence of people called my father, mother, brother, and sister, who make up my family. My father and mother are the people I love and respect the most in my life. Although sometimes I fail to follow their orders and make mistakes, they still love me, advise me, and always hope for the best.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">I also have two sisters and a brother. My eldest sister is 28 years old, followed by my second sister, 26 years old, and my brother, 23. Both our parents well-educated us. If we made a mistake, my father would advise us in a good way and never punish us. My siblings and I can be said to be stubborn individuals. Nevertheless, if viewed from a positive perspective, we can be considered individuals with strong opinions.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">Besides, I am a person of high confidence. Therefore, I am confident that I will be able to do my best in whatever task is done if it is carried out correctly and accompanied by persistent efforts. In addition, prayer is also a factor in a person's success. Therefore, every effort must be infused with prayer and high devotion.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">I like to do my tasks systematically. Therefore, I will live my daily activities based on my prepared schedule. This also helps me manage my time wisely because I always know what I need to do at certain times. Thus, I can save time. In addition, good time management is essential to me, who has the responsibility as a student.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">In my spare time, I like to read books. Among the reading materials that I choose are novels, magazines, and fiction books. I like to read because I get satisfaction from reading. One of my favourite publishers is Fixi. In addition, I like to surf the internet and read to gather information about the professional career I may pursue. I want to know more about a career before going into it to decide on my interests.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(184, 64, 104)">I have friends who always help me when I struggle to understand what the lecturer is teaching. I got to know them in the middle of semester 2 when we were still in online learning mode. Until now, we are still close and doing work assignments given together. I hope they will remember me when they finish studying later. I am grateful to be given friends who know me and care about me when I am away from my family. May God bless the journey of my friends wherever they are.</p>
